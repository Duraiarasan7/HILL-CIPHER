IMPLEMENTATION OF HILL CIPHER
Each letter is represented by a number modulo 26. Often the simple scheme A = 0, B = 1... Z = 25,
is used, but this is not an essential feature of the cipher. To encrypt a message, each block of n
letters is multiplied by an invertible n × n matrix, against modulus 26. To decrypt the message, each
block is multiplied by the inverse of the m trix used for
encryption. The matrix used
for encryption is the cipher key, and it sho
ld be chosen
randomly from the set of invertible n × n matrices (modulo 26).
STEP-1: Read the plain text and key from the user. STEP-2: Split the plain text into groups of length
three. STEP-3: Arrange the keyword in a 3*3 matrix. STEP-4: Multiply the two matrices to obtain the
cipher text of length three. STEP-5: Combine all these groups to get the complete cipher text.

## PROGRAM:
```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main() {
unsigned int a[3][3] = {{6, 24, 1}, {13, 16, 10}, {20, 17, 15}};
unsigned int b[3][3] = {{8, 5, 10}, {21, 8, 21}, {21, 12, 8}};
unsigned int c[3], d[3];
char msg[4]; // 3 characters + null terminator
int i, j, t;
printf("Enter plain text (3 uppercase letters): ");
scanf("%3s", msg); // Limit input to 3 characters
if (strlen(msg) != 3) {
printf("Invalid input. Enter exactly 3 uppercase letters.\n");
return 1;
}
// Convert plaintext to numeric values
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
c[i] = msg[i] - 'A';
printf("%d ", c[i]);
}
// Encryption
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
t = 0;
for (j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
t += a[i][j] * c[j];
}
d[i] = t % 26;
}
printf("\nEncrypted Cipher Text: ");
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
printf("%c", d[i] + 'A');
}
// Decryption
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
t = 0;
for (j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
t += b[i][j] * d[j];
}
c[i] = t % 26;
}
printf("\nDecrypted Cipher Text: ");
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
printf("%c", c[i] + 'A');
}
Thus the C program to implement Hill Cipher is executed successfully.
printf("\n");
return 0;
}
